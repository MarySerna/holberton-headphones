# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

## Requirements
- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript

# Tasks

## 0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file

Important notes with Figma:
- If your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing README.md

## Interactions note:
- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
